# Coding seminar at CMI@IIT

Coding seminar at CMI@IIT using Python 3.9 and above.

All materials are to be uploaded here, please be patient üôè

## Aim of this seminar

This seminar aims to help you solve problems **by yourself**.
For example, when you want to run Fourier transformation for your data, you google `Fourier transformation Python`. What you find will be [`scipy.fft`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/fft.html) page and you
read the code. Can you figure out
- where to type this code;
- how to insert your data instead of example;
- how to handle the data afterward?

This seminar covers up these kind of problems, so that when you find the solution you can directly jump to implement it to your code.

This seminar doesn't cover ABC of coding. For those totally new to coding, I recommend to start getting your hands on some basic coding lessons online.
